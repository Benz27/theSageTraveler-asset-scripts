## **About the Game**
**The Sage Traveler** is a 2D adventure game created as a project for a Software Engineering course during my third year of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT).  
The game combines problem-solving, critical thinking, and mathematics in a fun and interactive environment aimed at grade 4 students.

**Story**: A boy named Alex was preparing for a travel on a hot air balloon with his pet dog Rex.
He was packing his things that he needed for travel to his hot air balloon. He left for a sudden
to get his telescope from his house. Meanwhile Rex was in a hot air balloon wondering when he decided to
play with a rope that straps the hot air balloon to the ground, preventing it to fly. Trouble comes when Rex
suddenly free the rope and the balloon starts flying. Alex came outside the house when was horrified when we saw the 
balloon flying without him. He rushed to the direction of the balloon in hopes of catching it. He ran and ran until the balloon
lost from his sight. He was devastated but he knew he had to do something to save his dog. He decided to still follow the last direction he saw the balloon flying. And that is the start of his wonderful travel.
